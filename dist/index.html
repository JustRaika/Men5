          <h2>What is a Shader?</h2>
            <p>
            Shaders are programs that run on the graphics card to create visual effects and enhance visual experiences in applications. 
            They work by providing code to various stages of the rendering pipeline to generate high-quality visuals efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
            Shaders take advantage of specialized hardware in the graphics card, allowing them to run faster than CPU-based processing. 
            They're especially prevalent in video games, where their computational efficiency is critical for maintaining frame rates while adding complex visual processing.
            </p>

            <h2>How shaders evolved</h2>
            <p>
            Originally designed to add visual effects to shading (hence the name), shaders have evolved to serve many purposes across graphics applications. 
            Today, they handle effects like lighting calculations, color manipulation, bloom, contrast adjustment, and motion blur.
            </p>

            <h2>Anything special to mention?</h2>
            <p>
            Man, even the intro and the background stars are shaders.
            Everything you see in this project is created through modern magic.
