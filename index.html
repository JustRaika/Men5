          <h2>What is a Shader?</h2>
          <p>
            Shaders are programs or mini-programs that run on the graphic card to create visual effects
            and enhance the overall visual experience of the games. Shaders work on the principle of providing 
            code to various stages of the rendering pipeline to make high-quality objects. 
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, shaders take advantage of specialized hardware in the graphics card that can 
            generally run them faster than the CPU would be able to do. Their effect on the frame rate can 
            vary significantly depending on how complicated they are, but they're adding a chunk of extra 
            processing that is needed for each frame.
          </p>

          <h2>A little background of shaders (in video games)</h2>
          <p>
            In the early times, when shaders were initially designed, the purpose was to add visual effects 
            to the shading, hence the name shaders in video games. Now, in recent years, the working of shaders 
            has evolved, and they are used for different editing purposes in video games, such as hue and saturation, 
            bloom, contrast, and motion blur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using shaders in the game engine takes off the strain from the CPU and works primarily using the 
            graphical processor. Shaders play a vital role in rendering graphics by providing the GPU with 
            vertex and texture data, enabling the generation of lighting and color information. Through this 
            process, shaders contribute to the overall visual appearance of a scene or object in a game or 
            application. By manipulating the vertex and texture inputs, shaders can create stunning 
            visual effects, simulate various lighting conditions, and enhance the realism and immersion of 
            the virtual environment.
